# UniWRT LuCI Theme

UniWRT is a clean, modern LuCI theme for OpenWrt **24.x** and **25.x**. It uses original UniWRT branding and a network-controller style layout inspired by modern UniFi OS-style dashboards, without using Ubiquiti logos, icons, fonts, names, or proprietary assets.

> Project package name: `luci-theme-uniwrt`  
> Static theme path: `/luci-static/uniwrt`  
> Author footer: `Author: @Ox1d3x3 × UniWRT Theme v0.1.0`

## What it includes

- OpenWrt 24.x `.ipk` build path through the OpenWrt SDK
- OpenWrt 25.x `.apk` build path through the OpenWrt SDK
- Automatic GitHub Actions build
- Automatic moving GitHub **pre-release** named `pre-release`
- Build logs attached to every pre-release
- Modern glass-card UI, fixed left controller rail on desktop, rounded dashboard panels, smooth transitions, dark/light/auto mode toggle, mobile responsiveness
- Safe compatibility approach: UniWRT depends on and inherits LuCI Bootstrap ucode templates, then applies its own original CSS/JS skin

## Why this structure

OpenWrt 24.10 and older systems use `opkg`/`.ipk`, while OpenWrt 25.12 and newer use `apk`/`.apk`. The workflow builds both using the official OpenWrt SDK so the packages are valid router packages, not fake renamed archives.

## Install from pre-release

### OpenWrt 24.x / opkg

```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/ox1d3x3/uniwrt-luci-theme/releases/download/pre-release/luci-theme-uniwrt.ipk
opkg install luci-theme-uniwrt.ipk
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase='/luci-static/uniwrt'
uci commit luci
/etc/init.d/uhttpd restart
```

### OpenWrt 25.x / apk

```sh
cd /tmp
wget https://github.com/ox1d3x3/uniwrt-luci-theme/releases/download/pre-release/luci-theme-uniwrt.apk
apk add --allow-untrusted luci-theme-uniwrt.apk
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase='/luci-static/uniwrt'
uci commit luci
/etc/init.d/uhttpd restart
```

Then hard refresh LuCI with `Ctrl + F5`.

## Quick install script

```sh
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ox1d3x3/uniwrt-luci-theme/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

By default, this downloads from the moving `pre-release`. You can override it:

```sh
REPO=ox1d3x3/uniwrt-luci-theme TAG=pre-release sh scripts/install.sh
```

## Build locally with OpenWrt SDK

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential clang flex bison g++ gawk gcc-multilib gettext git \
  libncurses-dev libssl-dev python3 python3-setuptools rsync unzip zlib1g-dev \
  file wget curl tar xz-utils zstd

# Build IPK for 24.10.2
OPENWRT_VERSION=24.10.2 ./scripts/build-sdk.sh

# Build APK for 25.12.4
OPENWRT_VERSION=25.12.4 ./scripts/build-sdk.sh
```

Packages will be copied into `dist/`.

## GitHub workflow behaviour

Every push to `main` or `master` builds:

- `luci-theme-uniwrt.ipk` using OpenWrt `24.10.2`
- `luci-theme-uniwrt.apk` using OpenWrt `25.12.4`
- `build-*.log` files

Then it deletes and recreates a moving GitHub pre-release called `pre-release`. This gives you one clean testing release every time. After testing, create your stable release manually from the package files you trust.

## Revert to default LuCI theme

```sh
uci set luci.main.mediaurlbase='/luci-static/bootstrap'
uci commit luci
/etc/init.d/uhttpd restart
```

Or fully remove:

```sh
wget -O- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ox1d3x3/uniwrt-luci-theme/main/scripts/uninstall.sh | sh
```

## Design notes

UniWRT is **not affiliated with Ubiquiti/UniFi**. It deliberately avoids Ubiquiti logos, icons, fonts, names, screenshots, and proprietary assets. The goal is to deliver a similar clean network-appliance dashboard feel using original UniWRT styling, original SVG logo, and original CSS/JS.

See [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) for the UI direction.
